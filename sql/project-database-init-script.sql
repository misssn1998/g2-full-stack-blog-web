Camping is not permitted on the Milford Track.<br/>Huts have bunks, mattresses, heating, toilets, basic cooking facilities, solar-powered lighting and cold running water. A DOC ranger is in residence. The huts do not provide cooking utensils or showers.</p><h3>Day 1 - Glade Wharf to Clinton Hut</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 1-1 hr 30 min<br/><strong>Distance:</strong> 5 km<br/>After a boat cruise from Te Anau Downs (1 hour 15 minutes), take a leisurely walk through beautiful beech forest along the banks of the Clinton River to Clinton Hut, where all walkers spend the first night. Once you arrive, take some time to checkout the great swimming holes near the hut, or take a short walk around the wetland boardwalk.</p><h3>Day 2 - Clinton Hut to Mintaro Hut</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 6 hr<br/><strong>Distance:</strong> 17.5 km<br/>A gradual climb follows the Clinton River to its source, Lake Mintaro, at the base of the renowned Omanui&#x2F;McKinnon Pass. Past Hirere Falls you will get your first view of Omanui&#x2F;McKinnon Pass and the impressive Pompolona icefield. You''ll be dwarfed by the sheer scale of the rock walls towering above on either side as you walk up the Clinton Valley, and will pass through changing vegetation as you climb higher towards Mintaro Hut.</p><h3>Day 3 - Mintaro Hut to Dumpling Hut</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 6-7 hr<br/><strong>Distance:</strong> 13 km<br/>Climb to Omanui&#x2F;McKinnon Pass and the memorial to explorer Quintin McKinnon, with exceptional views of Lake Mintaro and the Clinton Canyon along the way. The memorial is a great place to take in the awe-inspiring panoramas, before reaching the highest point of the track and Omanui&#x2F;McKinnon Pass Shelter (1154 m).<br/>From here, you''ll drop steadily through an attractive alpine garden to the valley floor, passing several waterfalls along the Roaring Burn River before arriving at Quintin Shelter. On the way to Dumpling Hut take a moment to admire Sutherland Falls in the distance.</p><h3>Day 4 - Dumpling Hut to Sandfly Point</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 5 hr 30 min - 6 hr<br/><strong>Distance:</strong> 18 km<br/>From Dumpling Hut, follow Arthur River to the historic Boatshed. Further along the track, you will reach the dramatic Mackay Falls and intriguing Bell Rock. Admire the man-made rock cuttings alongside the Arthur River and Lake Ada, before spending the last 3 km on a smooth, wide track constructed by a prison labour gang between 1890 and 1892.<br/>A short boat ride from Sandfly Point will take you to your journey’s end, with world-famous views of Milford Sound&#x2F;Piopiotahi along the way.<br/></p><h3>Food</h3><p><strong>You cannot buy food on the track.</strong><br/>Bring food that is lightweight, fast cooking and high in energy value. For example:</p><ul><li>Breakfast: cereal&#x2F;porridge&#x2F;oats, firm bread, honey or other spreads</li><li>Lunch: cracker biscuits, cheese, salami, jam&#x2F;jelly, fruit</li><li>Dinner: instant soup, pasta or rice, dried vegetables or fruit, cheese or dehydrated (freeze-dried) meals.</li></ul><p>You&#x27;ll also need water, snacks, biscuits, muesli bars, tea or coffee, powdered fruit drinks and emergency food in case of any delays on the track.<br/></p>',

Overall a stunning walk and you get to see Kea and South Island robins too!</span><br/></p><h3>Places to stay</h3><p>There are three huts and two campsites, which must be booked well in advance during the Great Walks season.<br/>Huts have bunks, mattresses, heating, toilets, basic cooking facilities, solar-powered lighting and cold running water. A DOC ranger is in residence. Huts do not have food, cooking utensils, showers or bedding.<br/>Campsites have basic facilities including toilets, sinks and a water supply. Routeburn campsites have picnic tables and cooking shelters. Campers can&#x27;t use hut facilities.<br/></p><h3>Routeburn Shelter to Routeburn Flats Hut</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 1 hr 30 min - 2 hr 30 min<br/><strong>Distance:</strong> 7.5 km<br/>The track begins at Routeburn Shelter, gently winding alongside the crystal-clear Route Burn (river). After passing Sugarloaf Stream, you''ll climb to Bridal Veil Waterfall and continue above the gorge. A swing bridge leads to open grassed flats, and the Routeburn Flats Hut and Campsite.<br/></p><h3>Routeburn Flats Hut to Routeburn Falls Hut</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 1 - 1 hr 30 min<br/><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.3 km<br/>The track climbs steadily through stunning beech forest, providing views of the Humboldt Mountains. End the day at Routeburn Falls Hut, on the edge of the bushline and close to the impressive Routeburn Falls cascade.<br/></p><h3>Routeburn Falls Hut to Lake Mackenzie Hut</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 4 hr 30 min - 6 hr<br/><strong>Distance:</strong> 11.3 km<br/>Climb steadily up the valley, through wetlands and tussock-covered flats, before sidling along the bluffs above Lake Harris to reach the highest point on the track at Harris Saddle&#x2F;Tarahaka Whakatipu (1,255 m).<br/>Shortly after the Harris Saddle, the track brings you to Harris Saddle Shelter (day use only). Here you can take a break from the elements and use the toilet facilities provided.<br/>The track then descends and traverses along the exposed Hollyford Face, with expansive views over the Darran Mountains. This section of the track is well-known for its impressive array of alpine plants. A steady descent leads to Lake Mackenzie Hut, set beside the enchanting Lake Mackenzie.<br/></p><h3>Mackenzie Hut to The Divide</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 4 - 5 hr 30 min<br/><strong>Distance:</strong> 12 km<br/>Leaving Lake Mackenzie Hut the track crosses a small flat before climbing to the bush line. A gradual descent then leads past the ''Orchard'', an open grassy area dotted with ribbonwood trees, to the impressive Earland Falls (174 m). The track continues its descent through beech forest to Lake Howden (Lake Howden Hut was destroyed by storm damage in February 2020). <br/>From Lake Howden, the well graded track climbs steadily for about 15 minutes to the Key Summit Track turn-off. From the Key Summit turn-off, the gradual downhill walk is through silver beech forest to The Divide on the Milford Highway. At 532 m, The Divide is the lowest crossing of the Southern Alps in New Zealand.</p>',
